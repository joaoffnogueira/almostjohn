Layout. AVA Publishing SA: Switzerland, 2011Layout concerns the placement of text and image elements within a design. How these elements are positioned, both in relation to one another and within the overall design scheme, will affect how the content is viewed and received by the readers, as well as their emotional reaction towards it. Layout can help or hinder the receipt of the information presented in a work. Similarly creative layouts can add value and embellishment to a piece, whereas understated layout can allow the content to shine through.Layout is the arrangement of the elements of a design in relation to the space that they occupy and in accordance with an overall aesthetic scheme. This could also be called the management of form and space. The primary objective of layout is to present those visual and textual elements that are to be communicated in a manner that enables the reader to receive them with the minimum of effort. With good layout a reader can be navigated through quite complex information, in both print and electronic media.ImpositionImposition describes the arrangement (sequence and position) of pages as they will appear when printed, before being cut, folded and trimmed.The golden sectionBefore we can create a grid we need a page to place it on. In the field of graphic arts, the golden section forms the basis for paper sizes and its principles can be used as a means of achieving balanced designs. The golden section was thought by the ancients to represent infallibly beautiful proportions. Dividing a line by the approximate ratio of 8:13 means that the relationship between the smaller part of the line and the greater is the same as that of the greater part to the whole.Fibonacci seriesFibonacci number sequences are a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Fibonacci numbers are important because of their link to the 8:13 ratio: the golden section. These numbers are also used as measurements for font sizes, text block placements and so on because of their harmonious proportions.The GridThe grid is a means of positioning and containing the elements of a design in order to facilitate and ease decision making. Using a grid results in a more considered approach and allows greater accuracy in the placement of page elements, either in terms of physical measurements or proportional space.The symmetrical gridIn the symmetrical grid the verso page will be a true mirror image of the recto page. This gives two equal inner and outer margins. To accommodate marginalia the outer margins are proportionally larger.Asymmetrical gridsAn asymmetrical grid provides a spread in which both pages use the same layout. They may have one column that is narrower than the other columns in order to introduce a bias towards one side of the page (usually the left). This provides an opportunity for the creative treatment of certain elements whilst retaining overall design consistency. The smaller column may be used for captions, notes, icons or other elements, as the example opposite shows. In this way it can be treated as a wide space for outsized marginalia.Elements on a PageText and images make up the key components of a layout and they must be presented to the reader in a way so as to communicate effectively. A design’s ability to communicate is influenced by a number of factors: the position of the text and images in relation to other elements, for example, or what the focal point of the page is, type alignment and how white space is treated.Columns and guttersColumns and gutters are some of the most basic elements used for placing text and image in a layout.ImagesImages are the graphic elements that can bring a design to life. Whether as the main focus of a page or as a subsidiary element, images play an essential role in communicating a message and are thus a vital factor in establishing the visual identity of a piece of work.AlignmentAlignment refers to the position of type within a text block, in both the vertical and horizontal planes.Hyphenation and justificationThe aim of breaking words (hyphenation) is to produce text blocks that look clean and have no unsightly gaps or rivers. This is why it is important for a designer to control hyphenation.HierarchyThe text hierarchy is a logical, organized and visual guide for the headings that accompany body text. It denotes varying levels of importance through point size and/or style.ArrangementThe different elements that will comprise a design, predominantly the type and images, could be treated as separate components that are to be arranged on the page with clear distinctions between them.Entry pointsAn ‘entry point’ is a visual aid indicating where to begin reading. Newspapers, for example, contain textual content separated into discrete chunks – without this separation, the content would be too dense and too difficult to navigate or read.PaceAll written copy naturally has pace. Some passages are quick to read, while others require more contemplation.Controlling paceIn order to control pace, certain graphic devices can be used. The addition of a strong graphic statement, or the appearance of colour blocks can act as visual fullstops – encouraging the reader to pause. Ironically though, large text tends to be scanned rather than read. That is to say that the reader won’t necessarily read every word, but they will get an overall impression of the content.ScaleScale, when used in design terminology, applies to the size of images and text. Choices here affect the importance we attach to an image.OrientationOrientation refers to the plane or direction in which the elements of a design are used. Text and images are typically set so that they are read and viewed horizontally from left to right. Using other orientations such as vertical or angled is done typically to maintain a particular aesthetic in the design, as doing so makes the reader work harder to obtain the information by having to rotate the publication. This may encourage them to pay more attention to it, but can also have an adverse effect and make them lose interest.Structure / unstructureLayout concerns the structuring of elements on a page so that they can communicate effectively with a reader. Absence of a structure can also be used to good effect to convey certain characteristics in a design – although this in itself is also a type of structure. Unstructured designs can be some of the most visually creative and, by definition, are more difficult to control in order to achieve the desired results. When deconstructing fundamental layout principles to create an unstructured work a designer must consider whether the intended target audience will be able to identify and access the information it contains.JuxtapositionJuxtaposition is the deliberate placement of contrasting images side by side. The word is formed from the Latin ‘juxta’, which means near, and ‘position’. In graphic design and page layout juxtaposition may be used to present two or more ideas so as to impart a relationship between them, as seen in the example opposite." }, { "title": "Notes about Interactive Design", "url": "/posts/notes-about-interactive-design/", "categories": "UI, Design", "tags": "design, interactive, ui, ux", "date": "2022-05-24 08:00:00 -0300", "snippet": " Notes of: SALMOND, Michael; AMBROSE, Gavin. The Fundamentals of Interactive Design. AVA Publishing: London, 2013Interactive Design as a DisciplineInteraction as a medium expands and enriches traditional media.Design as a two-way conversation: For the first time, the conversation between brands and audiences is two-way – people can share experiences and create their own content. User-generated content (UGC)Designing engagement: All visual communication is about impact, audience engagement and the communication of a message. Interactive designers will experiment and innovate by using different technologies to engage the audience in new ways.Make it remixable. Make it mobile. Design different.The design document Table of contents and an introduction: these describe the purpose of the project, scope, document organization, the audience, and terms and definitions. A design overview: the project approach, goals and constraints, and the project’s guiding principles. The design specifications: colours to be used, palettes, images, overall aesthetic and feeling. Wireframes: the initial design prototypes, sketches, personas and scenarios. Project architecture: the technical aspects of the project, the requirements for programming, hardware and software and how the project will be launched. The implementation plan: this sets out project management requirements, time frames, costings and budgets. Rules: these are the client-specific constraints (use of colours, logos and client-specific language). Testing and usability: the plan of what is going to be tested, how the prototypes will be tested, and what metrics and measurements are to be used. Assumptions and studio constraints: general values and implications of using a target audience. For example, if the project is a website, there would be an assumption that the client’s audience knows at least how to access a website and use a browser’s navigation system. Ideas, Prototypes and Experiences ‘The ultimate inspiration is the deadline.’ Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari‘Good design is a lot like clear thinking made visual.’ Edward Tufte, data visualization pioneerDenise Jacobs from alistapart.com created a fi ve-point guide to getting inspired: ‘Gamify’ your work: be playful when approaching a problem. Adopting a play-based approach to problem-solving creates a more open mindset that is less stressed and more open to inspiration. Commit to overcome self-chosen challenges: if a project’s technical requirements seem hard to accomplish, spin that as a positive and use it as an opportunity to grow as a designer. Set clear goals and actionable steps: break down any large, overwhelming process into smaller chunks that are more manageable. Create a reward systemfor when each challenge has been met (for example, once a task is completed, take a break or go for a walk) and this can become a great motivator. Keep upping the ante: always remain optimistic and view each ‘failure’ in a project as a step towards the larger goal of creating that totally amazing end product. Focus on every positive achievement, as this adds to confidence levels and satisfaction in the job. Make it epic: think of the struggle for inspiration as a personal ‘heroic’ struggle towards an end goal. Become excited about how the project could change lives or create a buzz amongst your peers. Sketching and wireframing: Sketching is visual thinking; you don’t have to be a great artist or illustrator to be able to communicate or develop an idea using sketches. Industries and products can begin with a ‘sketch on the back of a napkin’ and so it is with generating ideas. Sketching formulates the essence of a project and begins the process of moving towards the end goal. Wireframing works similarly to sketching. For interactive designers awireframe is a sketch that outlines a project’s interactive components. For example, for a website this could be navigation and layout.The medium informs the design ‘If your user interface even vaguely resembles an airplane cockpit, you’re doing it wrong.’ John Gruber, creator of Daring Fireball blogCreate emotional contact and connection to the product.Persuasion design: Simplicity: Make it simple (even when it’s not). When designing an interactive project designers should ask themselves if the project can be summed up in one sentence. If it takes someone a few attempts to explain or contextualize the project, how is the audience going to explain it to others if they pass it on? Unexpectedness: Violate expectations; designers need to take what users expect from a website or app and see if they can offer something innovative or new. This could be the interface, the theme or the aesthetic (if a pre-loader to a website is engaging, it sets up a positive reaction to the site before any content is served). Concreteness: The core project idea must be explicit and direct. Everyone has influences and borrows from others; designers can embrace this and use it to shore up thematic or experiential aspects of their project. Once the experience is created, designers should not deviate from the ‘universe’ that they have created; stay true to the aesthetic and the concept. Credibility: Prove your credentials. When launching a new project designers have to consider that the audience may have no knowledge of the company or service that they are promoting. Inventing or incorporating ways for a new audience to engage with the service is crucial. If someone uses the app or the service and then tells their friends on Facebook or Twitter, word gets around and the product receives credibility. How should designers consider this element in the design? Emotions: Make people care. One of the best ways to engage an audience is by making them emotionally attached to the project. Can the emotional experience come from fun or from play? Or could it come from sharing thoughts, dreams, hopes and fears with others? Have these elements been considered in the design? Stories: Enable the audience to feel. Experiences multiply and change as they are passed from one person to another. Each time the experience is passed on, it becomes richer and deeper. What stories are the design team telling and how does this inform the user experience? User experience design (UX design) aims to design multisensory stimuli from which people can create their own meaningful experiences. UX design is relatively new; it emerged in part because of the advent of immersive, interactive technologies and their ability to engage beyond text and static images. An experience stays with people a lot longer than other media – it forms memories and positive associations with the product or brand.UX roots: Distinctiveness: Some of the best examples of experience design are spaces, such as museums and theme parks. Every museum and theme park has a distinct environment that can only be experienced by being there and by engaging with the stories in the environment. When a visitor sees an artefact in a museum cabinet, it doesn’t necessarily tell a story. The richer experience is one where interactive technology allows the story of the artefact and its owner to come alive in a meaningful and engaging way. Enablement: Story and narrative are powerful communicators, but how does a designer ensure a positive experience? The solution is in creating a more engaging interactive experience. For example, a museum exhibition on Viking artifacts would usually display a helmet or clothing with a text description and image. A better experience would be an interactive mix of video, animation and context based information that shows the artifacts in everyday use. This would immerse the audience in the historical life of the wearer and it brings the object to life. Relevancy: Part of being an interactive designer is understanding how to get into the mindset of a consumer. Designers have to be able to subtly manipulate consumers in order to make their experience as positive as possible. Designers can begin to explore what is relevant to the audience over time by delivering content and tracking what is useful to them and reacting to that feedback; it’s important to involve the customer. 4 Space: Where will people be using this project? Whether it’s in a museum, in Disneyland or in a bedroom, the design has to try to accommodate those spaces. The ability to think through how an audience will engage with the project is important. If the project calls for a touch screen in a museum, designers will need to allow for the different heights of users (a display that was five feet high from the floor would prevent an eight-year-old from using it). On-site visits are crucial to map where to best place the project for maximum impact (what is the space’s traffic flow? Where do most people stand when viewing an exhibit or ride?).The Industry ProcessPitch types: The request for proposal (RFP): Most studios are going to be involved in a request for a proposal. An RFP is a document sent by the client that outlines, often in detail, what outcomes they require. The studio then creates materials to answer the brief, and sends them to the client. This is a sort of blind taste test; there is no communication with the client, so the answer to the RFP has to stand on its own merits. If the materials are interesting to the client, the design studio is asked to prepare for a meeting with the client to pitch their idea. The invitational pitch: The invitational pitch often occurs when the studio already has a relationship with the client and is invited to come up with a design solution for a brief; or the client may have been impressed by the studio’s previous work and invites them to a meeting. These kinds of briefs are often less formal and much less competitive. Even so, the client needs to be impressed and the pitch delivered in much the same way as for a competitive ‘open’ call for proposals. Once a pitch has been accepted, managerial direction is required to help develop the idea into something tangible and workable. When creating products such as video games, websites or interactive installations, it is the job of an art director and project leader to communicate to the team the next steps involved in moving the project forward.Audience, Usability and Testing ‘Personas work because they tell stories.’ Whitney Quesenbery, user experience expertThe upside of personas: They establish common needs and goals for a disparate audience. If a designer needs to add a new feature, they can refer to the persona to assess its usefulness. Personas can streamline the production process, for example, it can target different users, so a project aimed at children and parents might be a different audience to teenagers or older people. Personas can be a useful evaluation guide; the designers can refer to the personas as a method of avoiding intensive usability testing. The downside of personas: Personas potentially lead to an artificial sense of understanding of users, which may mislead the team development process. Personas are not real people and so can’t talk back and ask questions; they are fictitious and artificial. Personas may be a composite of a demographic- based audience; they lack distinction and individuality The scenario: A scenario situates a persona in the process of using a product to assess its functional and aesthetic quality.Usability in design is the process of designing a product so that the audience can use it easily and intuitively.The eight rules of interface design: Be consistent: Consistency is important when designing an interface or application. For example, on a website, a company logo is normally a link back to the front page. If this linkage changes based on where the user is within the site, it’s confusing. Use shortcuts for frequent users: If a website or application has content that people return to often, make it easy for them to get to that content. For example, news sites allow users to choose the subjects they’re interested in, and sites such as Amazon.com store credit card details so customers don’t have to constantly re-enter the same information. Design informative feedback: Feedback is a crucial part of the overall experience. For example, on a web page the text loads first and quickly, rich media loads slowly (e.g. videos), so ensure that the initial content has some value. A large media site may take a long time to load, so use pre-loader animations to show the user that something is happening. Design navigation or dialogue with conclusions: A four-page news article, for example, should have a navigation system that links to pages 1, 2, 3 and 4. It should indicate which page users are on, so they can easily go backwards and forwards in the article, but also know the article’s length. Design informative errors: Websites should be designed so that if a link is broken or a page is missing the ‘error’ (known as the ‘404 error’ page) that is displayed is informative. Users should be able to navigate back to the main site and the error page should be considered as content in line with the aesthetics of the site. Design an ‘undo’ option: Anyone using a large website should always be able to get back to a previous page, track where they have been or move to the front page. Many web pages use a feature called ‘breadcrumbs’, which is a dynamic set of text links under the main navigation that allow users to track back to earlier content areas. Design for individuality: People relate best to systems that they find easy to use. The interface should be so easy to navigate that the learning curve is minimal. An example is Apple’s ‘swipe’ interaction on the iPhone or iPad. Once the screen is unlocked by using one finger, users have the model for all other interactions on that interface. Reduce any overload: Don’t have too many windows opening or too many tabs/options for users to navigate through or use. If elements are required, they should be added over time as users become more comfortable and experienced with the interface. Complexity should be added over time whenever possible. Magic Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two principle: Any more than that and the chances are people forget the options they’ve been given. Therefore, ifusers are given too many options in a navigation menu it’s confusing and unusable.The three-click rule: All content should be within easy reach of the user.The two-second rule: If a user waits more than two seconds for some kind of response from an online application, they may assume it’s not working or become bored and impatient. This does not mean that the application has to be superfast; instead, the application should always feedback to the user, for example using a ‘now loading’ animation.There are usability methods that consider how people read, interact, share and engage with content. Given that so many people have less time to spend on so many aspects of their lives, usability focuses on enabling the most rewarding experience as quickly as possible, while also allowing for deeper content to be delivered if desired. ‘The more users’ expectations prove right, the more they will feel in control of the system and the more they will like it.’ Jakob Nielsen, web-usability consultantUsability and visual comunication:Eyeline: Knowing where users are looking on a page or screen is a useful way of directing them towards important content. Faces are a great way of doing this; humans are always attracted to looking at faces. What’s interesting is that once users have locked onto a face, they tend to look in the same direction as the person in that image. If a designer wants to attract users to a certain area of the page (an advert, image or headline) this principle can work well.Good design credibility: People are more likely to engage with a well-designed site because a good-looking site equates to credibility in the mind of consumers. People learn that good designs (products and images that look good and are well made) are more expensive than badly designed or shoddy products. This translates to media and websites. If the site looks good and relates well to the intended audience, people will instinctively trust the site and worry less about buying from the site. A simple spelling mistake or bad grammar (along with bland images) can be enough to make the site seem untrustworthy.Don’t be afraid of white space: As with a visual composition, white space is important. When used wisely, it allows users time to look around the space without being bombarded with images and text. Visual clutter is very damaging, and projects that cram too much into their first screen have a slightly desperate feel to them. The white space doesn’t have to be white, it can be the background colour or space in-between paragraphs.Rule of odds: As in the image above, the rule of odds creates interest or focus for any image or content that is surrounded by an uneven number of other content. Three is better than two or four in a composition, people find it more visually agreeable.Symmetry/asymmetry: Symmetry in design can be achieved by placing like objects side by side to achieve balance and form. For example, four identical white vases on a shelf. Asymmetry disrupts this format and can draw the eye directly to an intended object. For example what if the third vase was much smaller and bright blue?TETO: Test Early, Test Often" }, { "title": "Launch Flutter app on Google Play - no debug symbols alert", "url": "/posts/flutter-google-play-no-debug-symbols-alert/", "categories": "Flutter, Android", "tags": "android, google-play", "date": "2022-05-23 08:00:00 -0300", "snippet": "If you’re trying to launch your flutter app on Google Play and you’re getting the following alert: This App Bundle contains native code, and you've not uploaded debug symbols.

The Production Manual: A Graphic Design Handbook. AVA Publishing: Switzerland, 2008Design basicsMeasurementsAbsolute measurements are measurements of fixed values. For example, a millimeter is a precisely defined increment within a centimeter. Equally, points and picas, the basic typographic measurements, have fixed values, such as the 48pt text above. All absolute measurements are expressed in finite terms that cannot be altered.In typography, many measurements, such as character spacing, are linked to type size, which means that their relationships are defined by a series of relative measurements. Ems and ens, for example, are relative measurements that have no prescribed, absolute size. Their size is relative to the size of type that is being set.The em: The em is a relative unit of measurement, used in typesetting to define basic spacing functions. It is linked to the size of the type so that if the type size increases, so does the size of the em, i.e. the em of 72pt type is 72 points and the em of 36pt type is 36 points. The em defines elements such as paragraph indents and spacing.The en: An en is a unit of relative measurement equal to half of one em. In 72pt type, for example, an en would be 36 points. Although the names em and en imply a relationship to the width of the capital ‘M’ and ’N’, in reality they are completely unrelated, as the illustrations above demonstrate.The em dash and en dash: An en dash is half an em dash and a hyphen is one third of an em dash, and so it is smaller than an en dash. The size of all thesedashes is relative to the type being set. An en dash is used to denote nested clauses, but it can also be used to mean ‘to’ in phrases such as 10–11 and 1975–1981. Em dashes are sometimes used to denote pauses in speech and hyphens are used in hyphenated words, for example, ‘halftone’.The pica: A pica is a unit of measurement equal to 12 points and is commonly used for measuring lines of type. There are six picas (or 72 points) in an inch (25.4 millimeters). This is the same for both a traditional pica and a modern PostScript pica. There are six PostScript picas to an inch.LayoutThe active and passive areas of a design: Within a layout, a designer has a great deal of freedom about where to place the different design elements. However, due to the way in which the human eye scans an image or a body of text, certain areas of a page are ‘hotter’ or more active, while others will be more passive or periphery. Designers can use this knowledge to help focus attention on an item, or to hide it away. The human eye tends to start processing the information on a page from the top left corner, before moving to the right and then descending the page.ElementsImage typesRasters: A raster image is any that is composed of pixels in a grid, where each pixel contains color information for the reproduction of the image, such as the continuous tone photograph in the example below. Rasters have a fixed resolution, which means that an enlargement of the image results in a quality decrease, as shown in the detail. Raster images are usually saved as TIFF or JPEG file formats for print, or JPEG or GIF file formats for use on the web.Vectors: A vector image contains many scalable objects that are defined by mathematical formulae or paths rather than pixels. Vectors are therefore scalable and resolution independent. As shown below, because vectors are path-based, they can be enlarged infinitely yet remain crisp and clear. Vector files must be saved as EPS formats to retain their scalability. They are used for corporate logos and other graphics, as they are easily portable and cannot be altered from within desktop publishing programs.ColorHue, or color, refers to the unique characteristic of a color that helps us visually distinguish one color from another. Hues or colors are formed by different wavelengths of light.Saturation or chroma refers to the purity of a color, and saturation levels describe a color’s tendency to move towards or away from gray.Brightness or value refers to how light or dark a color is. Changes in the brightness value can be achieved by mixing a color with black or white.Neutral gray: a color that is used to allow a designer to more accurately see the balance of colors in an image by providing a neutral base contract. Neutral gray is made from 50 per cent cyan, 40 per cent magenta and 40 per cent yellow, which in the RGB color space is 128 red, 128 green and 128 blue." }, { "title": "Notes about Design", "url": "/posts/design/", "categories": "UI, Design", "tags": "color, design, image, typography, ui, ux", "date": "2022-05-17 08:00:00 -0300", "snippet": " According to Joe Natoli materialsDesignDesign is solvilng problems. Not drawing pictures. Bad design have consequences. The principles of good graphic design are the same principles that dictate good UI design. Don’t look at themes: Themes look nice but they offer no explanations of what, how and why. These collections don’t tell us anything about the problems they were created to solve. We have no idea how decisions were made to use/implement these examples. We’re looking at pretty pictures, but we have no sense of whether what we see is appropriate. Don’t look for inspiration. I want you to understand that you will not find inspiration looking at the work of others. What you will find is someone else’s solution to someone else’s problem. The problem you have to solve belongs exclusively to you, your client and your users. Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. Seek what they sought. Matsuo Basho Don’t look at trends Designers are adopting the look without considering whether it’s appropriate for the situation, or whether people will understand what they see. Design vs. decorationDesigner: thinks hard about the appropriateness of the visual decisions s/he makes, and those decisions are informed by research, investigation and fact.Decorator: relies on his/her instincts as to what looks good and what doesn’t. Most designers who’ve never learned the timeless principles of design are in this category.Context of use is the key. Stop solving other people’s problems.5 planes of UX Planes   Surface Visual UI design Skeleton Navigation + layout Structure Information architecture Scope Requirements/specs Strategy User needs/biz goals Users are most often frustrated and confused when confronted with visual form that strictly reflects technical function. Implementation model reflects technology Represented model what design &amp; dev create better closer to Mental model reflects user’sunderstanding. As users, we don’t care how it works. Our focus is on the experience specifically, our expectation of that experience. Form should be determined by success criteria * not by function or personal aesthetic preferences. Function is only a single, isolated aspect of what drives + influences form.Form doesn’t (and shouldn’t) follow function.“Every force evolves a form. Mother Ann Lee” Audience needs Client desires Ethical obligations Aesthetic inclination Technology constraints Cultural presuppositions Functional requirements Material properties Avaliable time Avaliable budget Avaliable resources The form of a digital product is also the result of an elaborate balancing act between: UI design, information architecture, front-end html/css, middle tier logic, bachend data structures, programming and processes Don’t use form follows function as a prescription. On small screens, less is truly more. If it looks too complex, we assume it’s hard to use (or at least time-consuming) Icons without labels are worse than labels alone Designers believe that icons or pictures provide a greater degree of recognition while saving screen space. In fact, they often go unused * because they’re vague. Less chrome means users have work harder to discover it, particularly when it’s hidden beneath a gesture. If an opportunity to interact isn’t visible, people assume it isn’t available. Five rules for small screen design Focus on context of use. Simplify: each screen should contain one primary action. Design for thumbs. Design for fat fingers: controls and their associated tap targetsshould be a minimum of 9mm (48px) in diameter. Minimize the need to type. Principles of DesignBalanceBalancing any layout means arranging positive elements and negative space so that no one area of the design overpowers the others (unless it’s supposed to). Everything works and fits together. When a design is unbalanced, the individual elements compete with the whole.RhythmRhythm occurs when the intervals between elements are predictable — and similar in size, shape and length. When elements repeat at regular intervals, the visual rhythm speeds identification and the user’s ability to quickly: Infer What the elements are. Understand What they do.HarmonyWhen visual elements are in harmony, they relate to and complement each other. Harmony is a big part of What holds individual elements together visually, to form a greater, cohesive whole. Harmony comes largely from rhythm and from repetition. Repetition re-emphasizes visual elements, connecting and creating areas of attention. Harmony is a visual “echo”. Harmony is directional. Good design is held together by harmony.DominanceWhat’s the first thing you see? Where is your attention drawn? Dominance is achieved by emphasizing one or more visual elements. This creates a focal point, where most people will instinctively go at first glance. Dominance creates an entry point in the design; a starting from which you can lead the viewer to other parts of the screen. Dominance enables and directs flow. From a primary dominant element, design flow is achieved by creating elements with secondary and tertiary dominance. In other words, hierarchy. Dominance relies on contrast – clear differences in the visual field. By creating a dominant element, you reveal what’s most important in your design. You show people were to look first. When there’s no Clear dominance between elements, they compete with each other. Without a dominant element onscreen, users have to work to find their own entry point. We’re wired to conserve effort, which means the least amount of work may be moving on to another design – another screen, another site, another app. Greater size = greater dominance More contrast = greater dominance More negative space = greater dominance. Dominance directs user focus.AlignmentAlignment is the most important visual design principle I can teach you —and the one I see broken most often. Even if you do nothing but use proper alignment, your designs will be infinitely more useful, usable and understandable. Which also makes them more valuable. Align everything with everything else.ProximityProximity is the distance between visual elements. We use it to signal relationships between those elements. Elements visually close to each other are perceived as a single group, related by context of use. Unrelated items are visually separated, far from each other. Proximity describes relationships. Proximity often beats color+contrast. Use proximity to create context wich also creates clarity. Proximity makes cognition faster and browsing easier. Group and organize related content with proximity.Using Color and Contrast AppropriatelyColor provides visual cuesColor gets attention. Color stirs emotional response and suggests associated meaning. To prevent confusion in meaning, color has to be used consistently. To get the desired emotional response, color has to be used appropriately.Color comunicatesThe right colors draw the eye to the most important areas on the screen. Color can maximize readability and minimize optical fatigue. Color delivers symbolic meanings that support and enhance the visual experience of a design. Color pleases the eye and sustains visual interest.Color creates connection, continuity, implies meaningColor is subjective; our perceptions and biases affect what it says (and does) to us. Some colors have universal appeal; others are specific to geography, culture and experience. Color selection has to be appropriately useful and meaningful for your audience, your users. Do your homework here. Research, test.Color should highlight, not determineColor should never be the sole differentiator of things in the Ul. It should highlight and guide. For extended screen use situations, use light, muted background colors. Bright, saturated colors should only be used as visual accents. Start with one dominant neutral color, then add an accent color.Color theory is usefulBut you’re never going to have the time you need to fully understand color theory, much less apply it during a project.Use color to communicate + influence interactionConsider common associations: Black Authority and power; timeless; cool; brooding; counter culture (arts &amp; music) White Innocence and purity; cleanliness and sterility; surrender and peace Red Alarm and urgency; attencion; intensity; speed; warning of danger; love Pink Romance; gratitude; grace; admiration; harmony; compassion; female Blue Peaceful, tranquil; sky; ocean; business; technology; innovation; male Green Nature; organic; calming; refreshing; relaxing Yellow Optimism; happiness; warmth; positivity; joy; hope Purple Royalty; wealth; luxury; sophistication; considered feminine and romantic Brown Nature; Earth; home; friendship; richness; genuineness; solidity Consider emotional impactSeeing red has physiological impact: it’s been proven to increase blood circulation, breathing and metabolism.Red elements demand to be noticed, scream for attention.Red also signifies importance and priority, like a to-do list.Blue tends to have a calming, inviting effect, due to associations with Sky and water.This also communicates trust (banks, tech).Lighter blues are open and friendly; darker, shades suggest security.Green is often associated with nature, success, growth and money.Green sits right between warm and cool, making it well-balanced.It also feels fresh, new and, in western culture, signifies all is OK.Look at the world around youEverything you see contains the four color variations required for good Ul design: Shadows Midtones Highlights Accents Start with the brand colorsMost organizations have a brand color scheme they’ll want to start with (usually at least a logo).While that’s a good place to start, be careful about using large areas of those colors onscreen –* they’re often much too saturated.Vibrant, saturated colors cause eye strain – and fatigue.Choose color based on associations, emotions and brand.Contrast enables readabilityText is easily readable when stark, complementary colors are used.A design where text is the brightest element can reduce eye strain by focusing attention.Lack of contrast between text and background strains the eyes because they don’t know which color to focus on.The fact that colors are complementary doesn’t mean contrast is appropriate. If both colors are too bright, eye strain is again the result.Contrast draws attention and directs focusAreas of highest contrast draw the user’s attention first.Contrast should be applied according to the importance of a particular element.Primary content or actions should have the most contrast.Wherever you apply the most contrast is where the user’s attention will be drawn.If that element isn’t the most important thing on the screen, you’re directing the user’s focus in the wrong place. To things they aren’t here to see or use.Design with contrast purposefully keeps the user’s focus where it needs to be.The core content or action should have the most contrast.Secondary content and actions (and everything else) should have Iower contrast, by degrees.Contrast performs 3 essential functions Contrast draws the user’s attention to the essential components of the interface. Contrast helps the user understand relationships between onscreen elements. Contrast communicates hierarchy and signifies importance within and across multiple sets of visual information. Contrast always wins.Color and contrast depend on contextDesigning with Typography and ImageryTypography creates emotional impactTypography serves functional purposeAppropriate typography choices create: Readability Accessibility Usability Visual balance All of which work together to form effective, understandable visual communication.Typography should be purposefully designed.Choosing a font isn’t typographyAnyone can choose a font.Not everyone knows how to treat text as visual design – utilizing size, weight, space and style combinations – to establish visual order, signal relationships and enhance understanding.So typography isn’t about choosing fonts.It’s about purposefully combining letterforms to create optimal reading experiences – which deliver appropriate emotional impact.Pattern recognitionAlignmentKerningThe space between letters is called kerning.Kerning is critical to legibility, readability and comprehension.I was taught to spot good kerning like this: “The space between letters should be filled with the same volume of water.”This applies to space between words as well.LeadingLeading is the space between lines of text.In terms of Ul design, we call it line height.Increasing the leading makes text easier to scan and read, which makes comprehension a lot faster as well.It also serves to visually group related “chunks” of information.Seven Rules for Great Typography 2 typefaces max.: That means no more than 2 font families. Character widths and weights of each font should be complementary to the other. At the same time, font pairings need to have some visual difference; otherwise there’s no reason to use the second font. Limit line width: When line lengths are too wide, the eye has to work a lot harder to “track” the text – following and finding the beginning of the next line. This makes reading and comprehension more difficult – and much slower. The common standard is 60 characters per line. For mobile devices, it’s 30—40 characters per line. Choose readability: Text will be used at various sizes in your Ul, from headlines to body text to form labels to buttons to data to… A such, the typefaces you choose have to be readable at all of those sizes. Not to mention the fact that users will view your design on different devices with different screen sizes and resolutions. Your typefaces should have enough weight that letterforms don’t degrade at small sizes. Choose legibility: Make sure all letterforms are clearly distinguishable in your typeface. Beware of “L”s that look like”l”s, for example. Some fonts have poorly specified kerning as well, which can make an “r” next to an “n” look like an “M.” Or an “f” and “l” look like an “H.” TIP: most free fonts — aside from Google fonts – have horrible kerning. Use space between paragraphs: Visual breaks between paragraphs give the eye a place to rest; that rest actually speeds understanding and comprehension. A widely-cited study found that good use of white space between paragraphs (and in the left and right margins) increases comprehension by almost 20%. Generously spaced content is easier to focus on –* and easier to process. Align text elements in layoult using baselines: When you have multiple text elements on a single screen, they should all share points of common alignment. Even if those ‘chunks’ are unrelated, alignment helps keep the layout ordered and makes it easy and quick to scan. Use styles to visually differentiate content: When choosing a typeface, you want one that has at least 3 styles: regular, italic + bold. Use those Styles in your design to differentiate between types of content. Sometimes this removes the need for more than one font entirely – every level of information can be signified with styling. Five rules for choosing imagery Make sure it serves a purpose: And make sure you truly understand what that purpose is. What message will it send? What emotions will it evoke? How will it support/reinforce the content? How will it guide or instruct? Does it strengthen and deepen understanding, or interfere/distract from it? Focus on people (not things): We’re wired to recognize and connect with our fellow humans. You want people to see themselves using What you’re promoting. So an image of one of us using a product will always carry more resonance than an image of just that product. Images of people looking away from the camera also tend to work best – because that makes it easier for viewers to imagine they are that person. Cropping can change meaning: how you crop an image has a dramatic impact on how it’s perceived. Never go for the cheap shot: Especially if it’s sexist. Or demeaning. Or in any way reduces its human subject to an object. Not only is that shallow and in poor taste – it’s also quickly forgotten. Don’t forget the power of illustration: It’s easy to forget that illustration can be much more impactful than photography. Particularly when the subject is something we see a lot – and as a result are numb to. Illustration can be more relevant and appropriate to its content; it can provide powerful emotional support to editorials. Imagery dos and don’tsDO show an actual person when the reference to that person is specific.DO use illustration when specificity isn’t possible, or doesn’t apply.DO look for images that represent an tell realistic stories.Don’t use posed, staged stock images that feel faked and unemotional.DO if you’re referencing a specific product, show that specific product.Don’t default to generic, literal stock photos.DO use color and composition to create a focal point that communicates meaning.Don’t make the user hunt for the hidden meanings in your image.DO use images with only a few meaningful elements, with minimal distractions.Don’t obscure the point of focus, which also obscures meaning and diminishes power.DO strive for clear visual focus, which communicates the concept at a glance.Don’t use photos whose lack of focus makes the image meaningless.DO build a narrative; imply an interesting, informative story.Don’t use images without context; these don’t convey mood, brand, and context.DO show a product and people in the context of a real-world situation.Don’t show a product and its user disassociated from that context; it’s not interesting.https://stocksnap.ioCreating and Simplifying Visual CuesIcons make excellent touch targetsWhen sized large enough (e.g. 48 px), they’re easily activated.This also makes it very easy to hit them with a desktop or laptop cursor.Icons save spaceTheir compact size means that more icons linked to critical functionality can be displayed in a relative small space.Icons are quick to recognize if users have familiarity with the chosen icons and have seen or used them before.Icons should clearly convey meaning.Four core types of iconsSimilar icons are useful for simple, easily understood actions and concepts.Symbolic icons represent an action, object, or concept at high abstraction.Example use images of things that exemplify or are commonly associated with an action, object, or concept.Arbitrary icons bear no resemblance to the represented concept; their meaning is learned through repeated exposure.Icon choice starts with their environmentApp icons should be based on commonly used Android or iOS icons.Laptop software icons should be based on commonly used Windows or Mac OS icons, or commonly used software on those platforms (e.g. Microsoft Office, Google Chrome).Website icons should be based on commonly used icons, along with those used by competing or complementary sites.If you spend more than 15 minutes trying to choose an icon to represent something, an icon probably won’t work in that instance.Label + icon is hard to beatA text label goes a long way in properly setting user expectation and enabling them to predict the result of the interaction.Icons must be recognizable and memorable.5 rules for effective icon design Keep visual/perceived size consistent: icons that occupy the same pixel space on the grid aren’t necessarily perceived as being the same size. Check optical size with shapes – look for equal visual weight. Another way to tell that perceived size will be off is by checking the width of rules (strokes) used in the icon. When rule width varies at the same overall pixel dimension, icons will be perceived as being different sizes. Keep the level of detail consistent: More detailed icons will attract the user’s attention first – because they appear to have more visual weight than the others. Eliminate unnecessary detail: Extra visual elements only make the icon more difficult to perceive, even if it’s composed of recognizable objects. Think context. Don’t mix and match styles: For example, don’t mix outline and fill styles in the same app or site. Changing from outline to fill for a hover or active state, however, is OK. Don’t reinvent the wheel: If the concept or action depicted is common, near-universal, Stick with the established icon used to represent it. Anything else invites confusion and becomes a cognitive obstacle. Dealing with dataPersuasive (designer-viewer): Represents a specific point of view. Meant to change opinion or reinforce an existing opinion. Bias can be unintentional.Informative: (viewer-data): Neutral presentation of facts. Meant to educate as opposed to persuade (watch bias!) Broad/deep data sets, distilled or introduced in stages (progressive).Visual art(designer-data): Encoding takes precedence over decoding. When intentional, the intended outcome is usually just enjoyment. When unintentional, can have serious, negative consequences.Context of use dictates visual formWhat does the viewer need to understand – and how quickly or easily?What matters most - to us and to the viewer?Do the visuals accurately reflect the numbers?5 rules for great data design Data is only useful if it can be understood: If I don’t understand it, I can’t act on it. If I can’t act on it, it’s practically worthless. Data isn’t the goal – it’s a tool that helps us understand and make change in the world. Data without design is noise. You’re designing for other people: And they’re not you. You have to design for their identity. You have to design for their motivation. You have to design for their language. You have to design for learned social contexts: color associations, icon recognition, reading patterns, etc. You’re designing for their context of use: What amount of information does the user need in order to understand or act? What motivations is s/he coming to the table with? How do those motivations influence how useful or actionable the visualization is? How much time does s/he have to spend with this information? How quickly will it be useful or effective? The usefulness of data decreases when its volume increases: The more information in any given view, the harder it is for viewers to find What they care most about, or are depending on in order to act. Or What you need them to see. Reveal knowledge and facilitate insight – instead of overwhelming with volume. The more brainpower required to decode your visualization, the less that’s available for understanding it: You must respect this. Every label, every shade, every dimension of data that doesn’t directly contribute to your main message or to the viewer’s core goal is noise. Simplifying visual informationData: Remove backgrounds Remove redundant labels Remove unnecessary borders and containers Reduce colors; highlight most important data Remove all effects (3D, shadows, etc.) Visually separate labels/lines from data Remove extraneous lines and labels Cluttered UI: Increase negative space Remove unnecessary rules and containers Separate labels from content (tables &amp; forms) Separate primary, secondary &amp; tertiary actions Simpler is better.Separating content from controlsWhen there are too many choices it’s easier for people to choose nothing.When everything is interactive nothing is interactive.Content should be separated from controls: interactive elements should be distinct from their content counterparts.Separate primary +secondary actionsEconomy, clarity, and focus is created by differentiating primary actions.The same principle applies when there are tertiary (or even quaternary) actions." }, { "title": "Notes about Typography", "url": "/posts/notes-about-typography/", "categories": "UI, Typography", "tags": "design, typography, ui", "date": "2022-05-16 08:00:00 -0300", "snippet": " Notes of: AMBROSE, Gavin; HARRIS, Paul. The Fundamentals of Typography. AVA Publishing: Switzerland, 2011Type and languagePHONOGRAM: A written symbol, letter, character or other mark that represents a sound, syllable, morpheme or word.IDEOGRAM: A graphic element that represents an idea or a concept.ICON: A graphic element that represents an object, person or something else.SYMBOL: A graphic element that communicates the ideas and concepts that it represents, rather than denoting what it actually is.PICTOGRAM: A graphic element that describes an action or series of actions through visual references or clues.A few basicsA font is the physical means used to create a typeface, whether it be a typewriter, a stencil, letterpress blocks or a piece of PostScript code.A typeface is a collection of characters, letters, numerals, symbols and punctuation, which have the same distinct design.Standard typefaces generally fall into one of two broad categories: serif or sans serif. A serif typeface is one that has small cross lines at the ends of the different strokes, while a sans serif does not have these. These lines, often barely noticeable, aid our ability to recognize characters and help us to read by leading the eye across the page. For this reason, serif typefaces are typically easier to read than sans serifs. The clean lines of sans serif typefaces are seen as being modern, while serifs are more traditional.Letter formsLetter forms are the basic alphabetic and numeric characters that communicate within a design, and can be styled in many ways.Roman: The basic cut of a typeface, so-called due to its origins in the inscriptions found on Roman monuments. Roman is sometimes referred to as book, although book is often a slightly lighter version of the Roman.Italic: A true italic is a drawn typeface based around an angled axis. These are normally designed for serif typefaces. Obliques are slanted versions of sans-serif typefaces rather than a newly drawn version.Light: A lighter or thinner version of the Roman cut.Boldface: Bold, boldface, medium, semibold, black, super or poster all refer to a typeface with a wider stroke than the Roman cut.Condensed and extended: Many type families include condensed and extended versions that provide additional typesetting flexibility. Condensed types are narrower than the Roman cut and are useful for tight space situations. Extended types are wider versions of the Roman type and are often used for headlines to dramatically fill a space. Both of these versions are often available in weight variations, from light through to black.Serifs are a key characteristic for identifying a typeface – they can be employed in a variety of ways. Serifs are frequently said to enhance the readability of a piece of text by helping the eye to advance from one character to the next. Many serif styles reflect the zeitgeist of a particular time, with some more ornate or more bold, and others more discreet or more refined.Words and paragraphsType size affects white space.Flush left, ragged right: This alignment follows the principle of handwriting, with text tight and aligned to the left margin and ending ragged on the right.Centered: Centered aligns each line horizontally in the center to form a symmetrical shape on the page, with line beginnings and endings ragged. Raggedness can be controlled to a certain extent by adjusting line endings.Flush right, ragged left: Right aligning text is less common as it is more difficult to read. It is sometimes used for picture captions and other accompanying texts, as it is clearly distinct from body copy.Justified horizontally: Justified text allows the appearance of rivers of white space to appear. It can cause plagues of hyphenation if words are allowed to split to prevent this.The use of word spacing, hyphenation and justification functions allows for greater control of word spacing in a text block by controlling the space between words.Using typeArguably one of the most important aspects when considering typography is adding a sense of hierarchy. Hierarchy is a logical and visual way to express the relative importance of different text elements by providing a visual guide to their organization. A text hierarchy helps make a layout clear, unambiguous and easier to digest.Color can be used to provide a logical, visual hierarchy for text, in addition to providing definition, contrast and added meaning to text elements.The use of type on screen shares many of the requirements and concerns of type on a printed page. The same thought patterns govern the use of layout and the font choices made, but the end result is a little less controllable." }, { "title": "FlutterError - Unable to load asset", "url": "/posts/fluttererror-unable-to-load-asset/", "categories": "Flutter, Dependencies", "tags": "flutter, pubspec, yaml", "date": "2022-05-13 08:00:00 -0300", "snippet": "If you created your flutter project using the Android Studio wizard and you are getting the following error FlutterError: Unable to load asset when trying to use an image as asset, check your file pubspec.yaml.This is where you indicate the path to folders and files that should be included as assets in the project.I had created the base project with the Android Studio wizard and the pubspec.yaml had an indentation error, which is the source of the error.Incorrect indentation (newly generated project file):flutter:uses-material-design: trueassets: - images/test.pngCorrect indentation:flutter: uses-material-design: true assets: - images/test.pngNote that indentation is necessary to demarcate the envelopment of dependencies (since there are no tags that mark the closing).So each asset must be indented as a child of assets:, and it must be indented as a child of flutter:Other asset loading issues can be resolved by running:flutter cleanAlso, be careful with slashes when indicating the path of files in pubspec.yaml.Windows uses backslashes by default to indicate paths (\\), and this can cause your file to not be interpreted correctly.Always use forward slashes (/) to indicate the path of files.

Increase negative space.Negative space is NOT ‘blank’ space — it’s purposeful.Negative space enables focus, improves scannability and readability and clearly defines boundaries and relationships between objects.To boost signal and reduce the sense of clutter, we: Increase container margins on all four sides. Increase margins after each paragraph and line-height. Increase padding inside containers, cells, fields, buttons and other enclosures. 2. Remove unnecessary rules and containers.Every container ‘trapped’ by a rule obscures the most important elements and actions on the screen.Most containers actually work against their intent of separating content and allowing a user to focus.The extra contrast and trapped negative shapes that result actually pull the eye to themselves — away from the content or data the user is trying to focus on. So we further streamline the UI by doing the following: Remove any unnecessary rules; use negative space and alignment to create visual groups. Remove rules from existing enclosures with background colors. Use color instead of rules where possible. Visually separate navigation areas. Lighten any rules that must be used. 3. Separate labels from content (tables &amp; forms).Content and data should “come forward” and be visually prominent, the darkest thing on the screen.This creates maximum contrast, which allows the user to focus on the content.Labels, however, should visually recede, and should be clearly, visually distinct from the content they refer to. This goes for button and navigational labels as well.Here’s what we change in order to do that: Change case and/or color of navigation menu items (e.g. all caps/lighter). Change case and/or color of button labels. Make field labels lighter than text inside fields. Adjust contrast between heading and content container backgrounds. 4. Separate Primary, Secondary &amp; Tertiary Actions.When there’s no distinction between Primary and Secondary Actions, people make mistakes.Sometimes that just means inadvertently changing something, but in some cases it can mean mistakenly deleting a great deal of work!There are several ways we visually distinguish between Primary (most important) and Secondary Actions — and their distant cousins, Tertiary and Quaternary: The Primary Action is always a high-contrast button, appearing to the far left. Secondary or Tertiary Actions, when grouped with a Primary, should appear next, to the right, either as low-contrast buttons or text hyperlinks. Contrast of Tertiary or Quaternary Actions should decrease gradually for items of less importance. Unrelated functions should have a different visual appearance and be separated in proximity.
